##  Projects Overview

### 1.  Iris Flower Classification
**Objective**: Build a classifier using sepal and petal measurements to identify Iris flower species.

- Performed EDA using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Applied classification models
- Visualized pairwise relationships and feature distributions

**File**: `iris-classification/Iris_project.ipynb`

### 2.  Blood Donation Prediction with Machine Learning
**Objective**: Predict whether a person will donate blood using historical donation data.

- Applied SMOTE to balance classes
- Used a RandomForest model
- Performed hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
- Evaluated model using ROC AUC, F1, and precision/recall

**File**: `blood-donation-prediction/blood_project.ipynb`

### 3.  Netflix Data Analysis
**Objective**: Explore and analyze a Netflix dataset to extract key trends and content insights.

- Cleaned and visualized Netflix dataset
- Found content trends by genre, release year, and ratings
- Built visual dashboards using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

**File**: `netflix-data-analysis/Netflix data_project.ipynb`
